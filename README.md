# TensorFlow Lite Micro for Espressif Chipsets

[![Component Registry](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp-tflite-micro/badge.svg)](https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp-tflite-micro)

- As per TFLite Micro guidelines for vendor support, this repository has the `esp-tflite-micro` component and the examples needed to use Tensorflow Lite Micro on Espressif Chipsets (e.g., ESP32-P4) using ESP-IDF platform.
- The base repo on which this is based can be found [here.](https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro)

## How to Install

### ESP-IDF Support Policy
We keep track with the ESP-IDF's support period policy mentioned [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf?tab=readme-ov-file#esp-idf-release-support-schedule).

Currently ESP-IDF versions `release/v4.4` and above are supported by this project.

## Method 1: Using ESP IDF

### Install the ESP IDF

Follow the instructions of the
[ESP-IDF get started guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html)
to setup the toolchain and the ESP-IDF itself.

The next steps assume that this installation is successful and the
[IDF environment variables are set](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html#step-4-set-up-the-environment-variables). Specifically,
* the `IDF_PATH` environment variable is set
* the `idf.py` and Xtensa-esp32 tools (e.g., `xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc`) are in `$PATH`

## Method 2: Using PlatformIO

### Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `platformio.ini` file:

```ini
[env:your_env_name]
build_flags =
    -I ${PROJECT_LIBDEPS_DIR}/${PIOENV}/esp-tflite-micro/third_party/flatbuffers/include
    -I ${PROJECT_LIBDEPS_DIR}/${PIOENV}/esp-tflite-micro/third_party/gemmlowp
    -I ${PROJECT_LIBDEPS_DIR}/${PIOENV}/esp-tflite-micro/third_party/kissfft
    -I ${PROJECT_LIBDEPS_DIR}/${PIOENV}/esp-tflite-micro/third_party/ruy
    -Ofast
    
lib_deps = 
    https://github.com/espressif/esp-tflite-micro.git

; src_dir = 
    -I ${PROJECT_LIBDEPS_DIR}/${PIOENV}/esp-tflite-micro/examples/hello_world
```

## Using the component

Run the following command in your ESP-IDF project to install this component:

```bash
idf.py add-dependency "esp-tflite-micro"
```

## Building the example

To get the example, run the following command:

```bash
idf.py create-project-from-example "esp-tflite-micro:<example_name>"
```

Note:
  - If you have cloned the repo, the examples come as the part of the clone. Simply go to the example directory (`examples/<example_name>`) and build the example.

Available examples are:
 - hello_world
 - micro_speech
 - person_detection

Set the IDF_TARGET

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32p4
```

To build the example, run:

```bash
idf.py build
```

### Load and run the example

To flash (replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the device serial port):
```bash
idf.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 flash
```

Monitor the serial output:
```bash
idf.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 monitor
```

Use `Ctrl+]` to exit.

The previous two commands can be combined:
```bash
idf.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

  - Please follow example READMEs for more details.

## ESP-NN Integration
[ESP-NN](https://github.com/espressif/esp-nn) contains optimized kernel implementations for kernels used in TFLite Micro. The library is integrated with this repo and gets compiled as a part of every example. Additional information along with performance numbers can be found [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-nn#performance).

### Performance Comparison

A quick summary of ESP-NN optimisations, measured on various chipsets:

|   Target  |   TFLite Micro Example  | without ESP-NN  | with ESP-NN | CPU Freq  |
| --------- | ----------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |-----------|
| ESP32-P4  |   Person Detection      |     1395ms      |     73ms    |  360MHz   |
| ESP32-S3  |   Person Detection      |     2300ms      |     54ms    |  240MHz   |
| ESP32     |   Person Detection      |     4084ms      |    380ms    |  240MHz   |
| ESP32-C3  |   Person Detection      |     3355ms      |    426ms    |  160MHz   |

Note:
  - The above is time taken for execution of the `invoke()` call
  - Internal memory used
  - ESP32-P4 optimisation is work in progress
  - `Without ESP-NN` case is when `esp-nn` is completely disabled by removing below flag from [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt):
    ```cmake
      # enable ESP-NN optimizations by Espressif
      target_compile_options(${COMPONENT_LIB} PRIVATE -DESP_NN)
    ```

Detailed kernelwise performance can be found [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-nn).

## Sync to latest TFLite Micro upstream

As per the upstream repository policy, the tflite-lib is copied into the components directory in this repository. We keep updating this to the latest upstream version from time to time. Should you, in any case, wish to update it locally, you may run the `scripts/sync_from_tflite_micro.sh` script.
